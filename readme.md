# Project Proposal

1. Roughly, what will your drawing look like
I will draw the night sky covering the entire screen with pixels except for a couple of stars 

2. What are two variables you could use so that when you change each variable, the drawing changes?

size  of the stars 
size  of the lines connecting them

3. Where is there repetition in your drawing?
the stars are repeating themselves 

4. What are the main parts of your drawing? Are there clear sections or objects?
the stars are the objects in the frame 

5. How could you use a loop variable of a for loop? Is there somewhere in your drawing where something is repeated, but it's slightly different each time? Maybe the same object is repeated in different places, or maybe a similar object is repeated but with different sizes?

the stars i can loop their creation process
